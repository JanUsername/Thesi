\chapter{Conclusion and Further Studies}
\label{sec:ConclusionAndFurtherStudies}

Conclusions are \textit{not} a rambling summary of the thesis: they are
\textit{short}, \textit{concise} statements of the inferences that you have made
because of your work. It helps to organize these as short numbered paragraphs,
ordered from most to least important. All conclusions should be directly related
to the research question stated in chapter \ref{sec:ProblemStatement}.
