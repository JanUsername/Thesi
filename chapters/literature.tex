\chapter{Literature review}
\label{sec:Literature}

The goal: find out how micro-enterprises (synonyms?) how they develop, which processes they adopt, what problems they have 
its important to find out how they develop, which tools they use, which languages they use

since the goal is to adapt/use/configure sonarqube, we want to find out the needs of micro-enterprises

maybe the result is:
- we have to install sonarqube
- there are 3 typical problems everybody has
- for this 3 typical problems we develop sonarqube plugins or we recommend a open source plugin and we recommend how to configure it
